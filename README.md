# Coursera-Rails-MongoDB


You can find here an example on how to use
Mongo::Grid.
The GridFsFile is a class from coursera course: Ruby on Rails Web Services and Integration with MongoDB.
Here I commented some original code that used Deprecated methods from Mongo::Grid::FSBucket and refactored it with not Deprecated methods.

Updated methods in GridFsFile class are:
#contents
#save
